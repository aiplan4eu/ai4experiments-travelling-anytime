# ai4experiments-travelling-anytime
This repository contains the code that integrates the up-graphene-engine and the travelling-anytime problem (navigating a graph with costs associated to each edge, in an anytime way) to create a component in the ai4experiments platform.

The aiplan4eu-travelling-anytime component and the aiplan4eu-trvAny solution are generated from this repo.
